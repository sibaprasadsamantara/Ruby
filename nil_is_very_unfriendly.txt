class User
  def first_name
    self.first_name
  end
end

require 'ostruct'

user = OpenStruct.new(first_name: "Siba", last_name: "Prasad")
user1 = OpenStruct.new

user.first_name.upcase
=> "SIBA"
user1.first_name.upcase
NoMethodError: undefined method `upcase' for nil:NilClass


The user1 object does not have attribute called first_name that's the reason we are getting above error here.

What are all the possible solutions here

Solution 1:

  We can add condition here to call the upcase method i.e 

    user1.first_name.upcase if user1.first_name

 Disadvantages :

   This will lead to structural duplication and not a object oriented way because we are taking the decission on behalf of the object.

Solution 2:

  NilClass.class_eval do
     def nil.upcase
       "Empty user"
     end
   end

  Advantages:

    We have given responsibility to the object to take a decission i.e how to respond to upcase method.
    It's an object oriented way
    Supports Tell don't ask principle
    Generic way of handling the nil case 
    Implementation of polymorphism

  Disadvantages
    Always the interface should be in sync
    We have reopened the class in run time and deifned the method
